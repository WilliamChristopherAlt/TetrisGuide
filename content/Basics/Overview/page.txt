<div class="h1">Introduction to T-Spin Techniques</div>
<div class="text">
  This guide will attempt to explain T-Spin setups, from the fundamentals. There have been many guides out there and
  tons of helpful documentaion on harddrop.com and tetris.wiki, but despite the immense usefullness of these sites for
  getting to know how to do setups and gameplay techniques, I can't seem to find any articles that attempts to explain
  everything from the basics.
</div>
<div class="text">
  My goal is to compile a tightly structured list of T-Spin setups and explain how and each of every single one of them
  is designed, and that the reader should leave this guide knowing how they could've designed these setups themselves.
  And ultimately, I want you to feel confident enough to make a T-Spin setup of your own. Notice I will laser focus on 
  the core empty shapes that define T-Spin setups, not the outer stacking with actual specific tetrominos used to build them.

<div class="text">
  Knowing how to design T-Spins setups benefits one's soul greatly for the following reasons:
  1. It's fun
  2. T-Spin setups are aesthetically beautiful
  3. Knowing how these setups are built really helps you be more aware of efficient building structures in real battles
  So without further ado.... Here's the guide

<div class="h2">What Are T-Spins?</div>
<div class="text">
  T-Spins are advanced techniques where a T-piece is rotated into a cavity that cannot
  be entered through simple horizontal movement. They provide bonus points and are
  essential for competitive play.
