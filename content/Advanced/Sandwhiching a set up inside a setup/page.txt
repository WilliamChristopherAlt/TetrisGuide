<div class="h1">Sandwiching Setup Inside Setup</div>
<div class="text">
  Sandwiching a setup inside another setup is an extremely advanced technique that
  creates nested patterns. This approach embeds one T-Spin setup within another,
  creating complex and powerful stacking sequences.

  of another setup. This creates a compact pattern with multiple T-Spin opportunities
  in a single structure.

<div class="text">
  Executing nested setups is highly complex and requires precise piece placement
  and timing. The inner setup must be executed before the outer setup to maintain
  structural integrity.
