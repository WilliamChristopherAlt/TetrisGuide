// Minimal Tetris implementation for the modal, tailored to this project.
// Not a perfect guideline clone, but good enough for interactive play
// with custom piece sets and key bindings.

// All modal play logic has been removed. This file is intentionally left empty
// so that existing <script src="...tetris.js"> tags do nothing.
